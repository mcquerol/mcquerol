üöÄ About Me
I'm an Embedded Systems Engineer with a strong foundation in hardware and firmware development, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany. My primary focus is on real-time embedded systems, low-level programming, and FPGA-based development.

My passion for electronics, robotics, and software-hardware integration started at an early age and has since grown into both a career and a hobby. I am particularly interested in space exploration technologies, autonomous systems, and microcontroller-based applications.

This portfolio serves as a collection of projects that showcase my expertise in embedded software development, digital design, and system-level programming.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
I started actively using GitHub in 2023, and as part of documenting my previous work, I have programmatically pushed past projects using Python scripts. Some of these projects are still in the process of being properly structured and documented. This portfolio is a work in progress, and I continuously update it as I refine and expand my repository.
