### Hi, I'm Mateo ðŸ‘‹

Passionate Electrical and Electronics Engineer pursuing a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology with a focus on embedded systems at the University of Hochschule Darmstadt in Germany.

Education:
ðŸŽ“ Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronics Engineering) - University of Derby, United Kingdom (First Class Honours)
ðŸŽ“ Currently pursuing Master's in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (Major in Embedded Systems) - University of Hochschule Darmstadt, Germany

Since an early age, I have been captivated by the world of robotics, sparked by the incredible achievements of the Opportunity Rover landing on Mars in 2004. This fascination, along with my passion for math, science, and programming, led me to build and program my first Lego robot using National Instruments LabVIEW at the age of 11 whilst studying at the International School of Brussels.

Electronics is not only my chosen career path but also a beloved hobby. I enjoy working on side projects that allow me to explore and expand my skills. Additionally, I aspire to contribute my expertise to the European Space Agency or even NASA, where I could actively participate in groundbreaking Mars rover or rocket projects.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am a dedicated Lego enthusiast, and an avid guitar player.

Skills:
âœ… MATLAB, Simulink
âœ… National Instruments LabVIEW, Multisim, Ultiboard
âœ… Web Design (HTML, PHP, MySQL)
âœ… C/C++, Kicad, STM32, FreeRTOS, ERIKA OS, PSoC, VHDL, SystemVerilog
âœ… Soldering (THT)
